## Scope and Topics

The theme of this edition is the interplay between **microservices** and the **cybersecurity**.

On one hand, the adoption of microservices is fostering the adoption of new architectural styles and software construction paradigms; understanding the security properties (or the emerging vulnerabilities) of the resulting constructs calls for the development of a fresh mindset in analysts and testers alike.

In addition, the additional middleware layers often proposed for the management of microservice-based architectures could expand the attack surface of the systems.

On the other hand, the same frameworks could instead prove valuable allies to collect security-relevant information and to coordinate defenses.

These considerations are about the intrinsic interplay between the fields of microservices and security. However, it should be noted that the context is peculiarly sensitive to them. Microservices are adopted as an accelerator of Digital Transformation, as the successful past edition of the conference  proved, and security issues should be a primary concern, possibly taking the chance to integrate security-by-design into the microservice-led revolution in software development.


Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Design and implementation of microservice architectures.
- Empirical studies of microservices.
- Software engineering methods for microservices.
- Security in microservices.
- Formal models for microservices.
- Verification (both static and runtime) of microservice systems.
- Programming languages and techniques for microservices.
- Testing for microservices.
